 *
 * 1.71.1.1 03/05/12-16:24:16 (suhler)
 *   added a "serverProtocol" variable to allow handlers to change the
 *   protocol (e.g. http) the server claims to be using on a per-request basis.
 *   If "serverProtocol" is unchanged (the default), then the Server.protocol
 *   is used instead.
 *   This is useful when fronting Brazil servers with ssl gateways; the protocol
 *   can be changed from "http" to "https" to allow redirects to work
 *   properly

 * 1.39 00/05/15-12:02:23 (suhler)
 *   remove dependency on regexp package by putting in ugly code
 *
 * 1.38 00/03/29-16:43:43 (cstevens)
 *   Request was missing documentation of basic functionality.
 *
 * 1.37 00/03/10-17:11:33 (cstevens)
 *   Eliminated DataOutputStream from Request.java.
 *   Added a rechainable Properties object to Request.java
 *
 * 1.36 99/11/16-14:35:29 (cstevens)
 *   Request.java:
 *   1. If the "Content-Length" provided in the request was malformed, the
 *   log message should display how it was malformed.
 *   2. If Request.sendError() was called, it was logging the word "null"
 *   if the user passed in null for the detail message.  Aesthetically
 *   displeasing.
 *   3. If Request.sendError() is called when part of a response has already
 *   been sent, it cannot send the error headers and error message, because
 *   that would confuse things, so it must just close the connection.  That
 *   was done right, but it wasn't bumping the Server.errorCount.  It still
 *   should do that always.
 *
 * 1.35 99/11/03-17:52:31 (cstevens)
 *   MultiHostHandler.
 *
 * 1.34 99/10/26-18:54:35 (cstevens)
 *   Eliminate public methods Server.initHandler() and Server.initObject().
 *   Get rid of public variables Request.server and Request.sock:
 *   A. In all cases, Request.server was not necessary; it was mainly used for
 *   constructing the absolute URL for a redirect, so Request.redirect() was
 *   rewritten to take an absolute or relative URL and do the right thing.
 *   B. Request.sock was changed to Request.getSock(); it is still rarely used
 *   for diagnostics and logging (e.g., ChainSawHandler).
 *   HTTP request returned ungracefully if "Content-Length" in a POST was
 *   negative or too much to allocate.
 *
 * 1.33 99/10/25-15:48:03 (cstevens)
 *   Merged changes between child workspace "/home/cstevens/ws/brazil/naws" and
 *   parent workspace "/export/ws/brazil/naws".
 *
 * 1.31.1.1 99/10/25-15:38:48 (cstevens)
 *   String.equals() can take null.
 *
 * 1.32 99/10/25-14:32:44 (suhler)
 *   missing content length
 *
 * 1.25.2.1 99/10/23-19:49:32 (rinaldo)
 *
 * 1.31 99/10/19-18:57:53 (cstevens)
 *   toString
 *
 * 1.30 99/10/14-13:14:59 (cstevens)
 *   Merged changes between child workspace "/home/cstevens/ws/brazil/naws" and

 *   @author & @version
 *
 * 1.28.1.2 99/10/14-12:54:36 (cstevens)
 *   don't display socket information twice when logging.
 *   rewrite sendResponse() to take InputStream rather than HttpInputStream.
 *   Maybe this is a bad idea.
 *
 * 1.29 99/10/11-12:36:25 (suhler)
 *   Merged changes between child workspace "/home/suhler/brazil/naws" and

 * Represents an HTTP transaction.   A new instance is created

 * <p>
 * Utility methods that are generically useful for manipulating HTTP
 * requests are included here as well.  An instance of this class is
 * passed to handlers.  There will be exactly one request object per thead
 * at any time.
 * <p>
 * The fields
 * {@link #headers}, 
 * {@link #query}, and
 * {@link #url}, and the method
 * {@link #getQueryData()}
 * are most often used to examine the content of the request.
 * The field
 * {@link #props}
 * contains information about the server, or up-stream handlers.
 * <p>
 * The methods
 * {@link #sendResponse(String, String, int)} and
 * {@link Request#sendError(int, String)}
 * are commonly used to return content to the client.  The methods
 * {@link #addHeader(String)} and
 * {@link #setStatus(int)} can be used to modify the response headers
 * and return code respectively before the response is sent.
 * <p>
 * Many of the other methods are used internally, but can be useful to
 * handlers that need finer control over the output that the above methods
 * provide.  Note that the order of the methods is important.  For instance,
 * the user cannot change the HTTP response headers (by calling the
 * <code>addHeader</code> method or by modifying the
 * <code>responseHeaders</code> field) after having already sent an HTTP
 * response.
 * <p>
 * A number of the fields in the <code>Request</code> object are public,
 * by design.  Many of the methods are convenience methods; the underlying
 * data fields are meant to be accessed for more complicated operations,
 * such as changing the URL or deleting HTTP response headers.

     * <p>

     * has an existing set of <code>Properties</code> and is faced with
     * copying its contents into <code>request.props</code> and/or trying
     * to share the existing <code>Properties</code> object among multiple

     * object can be added multiple times safely.  However, the search
