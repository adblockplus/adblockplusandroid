<p>
It seems like your device is running Android 2.3 or older. 
This version of Android does not support configuring a proxy,
but several manufacturers have added settings for that to their devices. 
Take a look at our <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/android-config#proxy">device-specific instructions</a>.

<p>
If your device does support configuring a proxy,
please use <strong>localhost</strong> as the host name and <strong>%d</strong> as the port number.
